I am a system engineer specializing in battery performance, modeling, and validation, with a strong background in energy storage systems and innovative technologies. Originally from Quito, Ecuador, I have participated in technological ventures and research projects before moving to France to pursue my Master’s and PhD studies. Currently, I work at Ampere – Renault Group as a Pilote Fonction Système, where I focus on the validation and optimization of battery state estimators (SOH, SOCE) within the GTR-EVE regulatory framework. My expertise includes data analysis, system calibration, and performance evaluation for electric vehicle batteries, integrating advanced tools like MATLAB, Python, Converto AVL, Power BI, and Excel.
I have quickly adapted to life in France and am excited to continue contributing to the development of cutting-edge battery technologies. My passion lies in advancing sustainable mobility solutions through technical innovation and strategic thinking.
Outside of work, I enjoy cycling, cooking, and traveling to explore fascinating new places. I also love diving into DIY projects and technological innovations, constantly seeking new challenges to expand my skills.
