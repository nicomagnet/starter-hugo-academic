I am an experienced energy professional with a strong background in technology innovative solutions in the field of energy and batteries. Originally from Quito, Ecuador, where I participated in technological ventures and projects and later moved to France to continue my master and PhD studies. I have quickly adapted to this beautiful country and wish to continue working here, taking advantage of my experience in battery modeling and a strategic vision with meaningful impact. Outside the professional field, I enjoy cycling, cooking, and traveling to discover new fascinating places and enrich my knowledge. I also enjoy exploring interesting technological projects and I love DIY.
